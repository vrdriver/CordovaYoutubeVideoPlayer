# Cordova YoutubeVideoPlayer Plugin

This has been updated to work for Ionic 6 as at 2022 April 25th.

I'm taking not credit for these changes, but needed to find a solution that was going to work for me. Others may find it helpful though.

**Play Youtube Videos in a native Video Player on Android &amp; iOS.**
**This fork works on Android 6, and does not force landscape mode on Android.**


Original iOS plugin uses **XCDYouTubeKit** by CÃ©dric Luthi:  
https://github.com/0xced/XCDYouTubeKit

This repository now uses updated code at: https://github.com/vrdriver/XCDYouTubeKit

Android version (up to 4.4) uses **OpenYoutubeActivity** by Keyes Labs:  
https://code.google.com/p/android-youtube-player

Android version (5.0+) uses YouTube Android Player API:
https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/reference/com/google/android/youtube/player/YouTubePlayer

Android with YouTube App Version 111662130 requires a workaround to resolve an App issue:

## Installation

```sh
cordova plugin add https://github.com/vrdriver/CordovaYoutubeVideoPlayer
```

## Usage

```javascript
YoutubeVideoPlayer.openVideo('YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID', function(result) { console.log('YoutubeVideoPlayer result = ' + result); });
```

For Android 5.0+ you will need to add the following to config.xml

```xml
<preference name="YouTubeDataApiKey" value="[YOUR YOUTUBE API]" />
```
with your own YouTube Key.

If you are using Capacitor, you'll potentially get a gradle error that will leave after you open the project and gradle files are built. The other thing is that you may need to add the following line to your Android project:
Android/local.properties:

    YOUTUBE_API_KEY="YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY"

The callback is called when the video window is closed.  (Work in Progress - should be working for IOS).
